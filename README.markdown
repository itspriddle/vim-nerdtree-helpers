# NERDTree Helpers

This plugin contains the NERDTree helpers found in
[Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus). 

I extracted them because I do not personally use Janus. I wasn't able to
get these helpers working in both `vim` and `mvim` by placing them in
`vimrc`, so I created a plugin.

## Installation

Pathogen:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/itspriddle/vim-nerdtree-helpers.git nerdtree-helpers

Old school:

    cd ~/tmp
    git clone git://github.com/itspriddle/vim-nerdtree-helpers.git
    cp vim-nerdtree-helpers/plugin/nerdtree-helpers.vim ~/.vim/plugin/
